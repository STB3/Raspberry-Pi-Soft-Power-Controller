# AVR Code

The project I developed this controller for is based on a Arduino Leonardo. That board uses a 32u4 AVR chip. The code itself should be compatible with the 328p and 2560 based boards. However, you will need to change up the I/O pins. (I'm using a custom board.)

Commit b4071b1ddd632b1c1035af2f0c8c23c28ab442d6 was a complete re-write of the original code. As of that commit, it is still a bit messy. However, it works. :)
